# Drowsiness_Detection
The number of fatalities on the road due to drowsiness is very high. Thus python allows the model of deep learning algorithm via including the use of OpenCV. Drowsiness Detection is the detection of a person to check whether the person is feeling sleepy while performing a significant task. This detection has many applications in medical and safety fields. This detection can be quickly done using “shape predictor face landmarks” that mark the essential landmarks on the face.

Thus python also provides the flexibility for detecting such serious and significant detection via OpenCV modules. One can easily make their own phone camera for detecting drowsiness with the below-provided code in python.
